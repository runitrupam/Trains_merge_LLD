Some assumptions I have taken : 
 If there are no passenger bogies to travel from Hyderabad station,
  then train should stop there. In such a case it should print JOURNEY_ENDED 
e.g. 
ARRIVAL TRAIN_A ENGINE NJP GHY AGA BPL PTA
ARRIVAL TRAIN_B JOURNEY_ENDED
DEPARTURE TRAIN_B ENGINE GHY NJP PTA AGA BPL

For journey continue after HYB , 
ARRIVAL TRAIN_A ENGINE NDL NDL GHY NJP NGP
ARRIVAL TRAIN_B ENGINE NJP GHY AGA BPL PTA
DEPARTURE TRAIN_AB ENGINE ENGINE GHY GHY NJP NJP PTA NDL NDL AGA BPL NGP
