>Context 
 There are 2 super fast trains, Train A and Train B. Train A travels from Chennai to New Delhi. Train B travels from Trivandrum to Guwahati.
 
 Passengers can board these trains only at the source station. 
 The trains have only reserved bogies and each bogie will only have passengers to a specific station. 
 When the train arrives at a station, the entire bogie with passengers is detached from the train, and the train continues its journey. 
 The routes with station code and distances of each station from originating station are as follows: (STATION (CODE) - DISTANCE ): 

```
    Train A                         	Train B
 CHENNAI (CHN) - 0	             TRIVANDRUM (TVC) -0
 SALEM (SLM) - 350	             SHORANUR (SRR) - 300
 BANGALORE (BLR) - 550	         MANGALORE (MAQ) - 600
 KURNOOL (KRN) - 900	           MADGAON (MAO) - 1000
 HYDERABAD (HYB) - 1200       	 PUNE (PNE) - 1400
 NAGPUR (NGP) - 1600	           HYDERABAD (HYB) - 2000
 ITARSI (ITJ) - 1900	           NAGPUR (NGP) - 2400
 BHOPAL (BPL) - 2000	           ITARSI (ITJ) - 2700
 AGRA (AGA) - 2500	             BHOPAL (BPL) - 2800
 NEW DELHI (NDL) - 2700          PATNA (PTA) - 3800
 	                               NEW JALPAIGURI (NJP) - 4200
 	                               GUWAHATI (GHY) - 4700

> The Merger
```
 During a part of their journey, these trains follow the same route and travel as one train - Train AB. 
 
 Trains start from their respective source stations and meet at Hyderabad. 
 Trains travel as Train AB from Hyderabad till Bhopal as a single train. 
 From Bhopal the trains travel again as two independent trains, Train A and Train B. 
 Train A can have passengers in the route for Train B and vice versa.    Eg: People can board from Chennai in Train A and travel to Guwahati. 
Merging Rules
 First, both the engines are attached. 
 The remaining bogies from Hyderabad are attached in the descending order of distances they have to travel further from Hyderabad. 
 When the merged train reaches a station, the bogie for that station will be the last one and it can be detached quickly. 
```


> Assumptions
 The passengers board only from the source station. 
 If there are no passenger bogies to travel from Hyderabad station, then train should stop there. In such a case it should print JOURNEY_ENDED 
 The distances are in kilometers. 
 If there are multiple bogies with same station as its destination, then they can be arranged next to each other when the Train AB leaves Hyderabad. 



Input format
 Your program should take as input the order of bogies of each train from the source station
 ```
TRAIN_A  ENGINE BOGIE_1 BOGIE_2 BOGIE_3 ... BOGIE_N 
TRAIN_B  ENGINE BOGIE_1 BOGIE_2 BOGIE_3 ... BOGIE_N 
Examples :
TRAIN_A  ENGINE NDL NDL KRN GHY SLM NJP NGP BLR 
TRAIN_B  ENGINE NJP GHY AGA PNE MAO BPL PTA
```

Output format
```
 The output should be 
 The order of bogies for Train A while arriving at Hyderabad. 
 The order of bogies for Train B while arriving at Hyderabad. 
 The order of bogies for Train AB (merged train) while departing from Hyderabad. 
Examples :
ARRIVAL  TRAIN_A ENGINE NDL NDL GHY NJP NGP 
ARRIVAL  TRAIN_B ENGINE NJP GHY AGA BPL PTAP 
DEPARTURE  TRAIN_AB ENGINE ENGINE GHY GHY NJP NJP PTA NDL NDL AGA BPL NGP
